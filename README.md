This repository is my own take on jawj's OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier 
It is a simple solution for Android development with Google Maps API and Android Maps Util

Add this dependency to your app gradle.build file:

compile 'com.github.bcruts:clusterexpanding:0.0.1'
